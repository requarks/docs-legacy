<!-- TITLE: Creating folder landing pages -->

When you visit _yoursite.com/path/to/folder_ and the folder exists, but there is no file ```folder.md```, then you will be prompted to create it. Then, when you visit _yoursite.com/path/to/folder_, ```folder.md``` will be served up as the home page.

Note: the root of _yoursite.com_ serves up ```home.md``` as the front page of your site.

## Listing all pages inside a folder

The special path _yoursite.com/path/to/folder/all_ will display a list of all the pages inside a folder -- just like the top level "All Pages" link in the sidebar.
